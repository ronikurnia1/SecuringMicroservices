1. On GloboTicket.Gateway project,
   - Modify appsetting.json file by adding the following config 
     on "/shoppingbasket/api/baskets/{all}" and "/shoppingbasket/api/baskets" UpstreamPathTemplate 
     inside AuthenticationOptions:
        "AllowedScopes": [ "eventcatalog.fullaccess" ]

   - Modify appsetting.json file by adding the following config 
     on "/eventcatalog/api/categories", "/eventcatalog/api/events",
     "/eventcatalog/api/events/{id}", "/api/events/?categoryId={id}" UpstreamPathTemplate:

         "AuthenticationOptions": {
            "AuthenticationProviderKey": "GloboTicketGatewayAuthenticationScheme",
            "AllowedScopes": [ "eventcatalog.fullaccess" ]
          },
 

    - Modify appsetting.json file by removing the following config from
      "/shoppingbasket/api/baskets" and "/shoppingbasket/api/baskets/{all}",
      UpstreamPathTemplate:

          "AddHeadersToRequest": {
            "CurrentUser": "Claims[sub] > value"
          }

2. On GloboTicket.Services.ShoppingBasket project,
   - Modify CheckoutBasketAsync() method on BasketsController.cs file
     by commeting out the following line of code:
            var userId = Guid.Parse(HttpContext.Request.Headers["CurrentUser"][0]);
     
     and add new code:

            var userId = Guid.Parse(User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Type == "sub")?.Value);


3. Put breakpoint on the above code and on the following line of code:
  
   var response = await client.GetAsync("api/events");
   inside EventCatalogService.cs file GetAll() method on GloboTicket.Web project 

4. Debug the app and check the token as well as the UserId see if it works (there is no "userId" available)

5. Stop debuging and fix the issue by adding the following code on Startup.cs file inside 
   ConfigureServices() method on GloboTicket.Services.ShoppingBasket project:       
        JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();

6. Debug again the app and do checkout and see if the "userId" is available now.

7. Try different scenario by removing/commenting the following code from Startup.cs
   file on GloboTicket.Web project:

             //   options.Scope.Add("eventcatalog.fullaccess");

8. Debug the app and check the token and see if it gets blocked by API Gateway 
   (not by microservice) when accessing event catalog service
